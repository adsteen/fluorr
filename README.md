# fluorr

**fluorr** is a package to analyze excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence data using R. 

The near-term goal is simply to be able to generate and visualize EEMs from raw data that are correctly calibrated and corrected for inner-filter effects. In the longer term, I intend to include functionality for [parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.4319/lom.2008.6.572/full) which is frequently used to deconvolve EEMs into consituent parts.
